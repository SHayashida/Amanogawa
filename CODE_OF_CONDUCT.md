# Code of Conduct

## Our standards
We want a welcoming, inclusive community. Please:
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and communicate clearly.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks.

## Scope
This code of conduct applies to project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions) and
to one-on-one communications related to the project.

## Enforcement
Project maintainers may moderate content and take action, including warnings,
temporary restrictions, or permanent bans for repeated or severe violations.

## Reporting
To report a concern, contact the maintainer (see README contact section). If you
prefer, you may also open a private communication channel via GitHub.
